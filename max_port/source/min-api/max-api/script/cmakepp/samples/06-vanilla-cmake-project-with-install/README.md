# Installing and Using Projects with vanilla `CMake`

## Using the `CMake` install functionality and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

This sample creates a project call `install_project` which is installed to the cmake prefix path `/prefix_dir`.  

Then another project uses this installed library to run a simple addition.

This is all done with vanilla `CMake` and is more of a learning experiment for me.


## Usage

See `test.cmake`
