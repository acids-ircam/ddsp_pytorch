## Description

In this sample I will show you how to create a simple compressed package which allows you to provide the client (the person using your package) with a `CMake` function which generates a source document.  

I will show you how to install this package in a standard cmake project.

Lastly I will show you how to setup your `CMakeLists.txt` to use the installed package.


## Prerequisites
