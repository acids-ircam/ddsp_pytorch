## HTTP Client

`CMake` has a built in `cUrl` module which it exposes over its `file` function - more precise: `file(DOWNLOAD)` and `file(UPLOAD)`.  These functions actually perform a `GET` resp. `PUT` request on the designated uri.  I used these capabilities to create a  `http_get` and `http_put` function which works like one might expect a http client to work.

*Example*
