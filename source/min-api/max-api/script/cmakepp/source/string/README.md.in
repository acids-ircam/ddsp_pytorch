## String Functions
<%
    assign(function_files = glob("**.cmake" --relative))
%>

`CMake` has one utility for working with string: `string()`. Inside of the jewel there is hidden lots of functionality which just has to be exposed correctly to the user.  I also wanted to expose this functionality in the `cmakepp` way of doing things (ie `return values`)

So I have created somewhat alot of functions which does things that you might need and alot of what you will probably never need - but feel good about because its there :)


### Function List

<%= markdown_template_function_list('${function_files}') %>
