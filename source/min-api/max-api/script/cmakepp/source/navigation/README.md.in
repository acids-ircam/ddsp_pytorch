# Navigation Functions
<%
    assign(function_files = glob("**.cmake" --relative))
%>


After creating `maps` and `objects` it was only prudent to create something that enables ease of use for the user.

Only using `map_set` and `map_get` like functions is very frustrating especially if the depth of an object graph is more than one. consider:
```cmake
map_tryget(${obj} a)
ans(val_a)
if(val_a)
    map_tryget(${val_a} b)
    ans(val_b)
    ...
endif()
```


So I created the `assign` function which brings great comfort to navigating a object graph.  It supports assignment to and from any navigation expression. navigation expressions support property navigation and range based list access.

Here are some **Examples**:



## Function List

<%= markdown_template_function_list('${function_files}') %>

## Function Descriptions

<%= markdown_template_function_descriptions('${function_files}') %>
