Embedded shape:  torch.Size([2, 400, 65])
Kernel:  torch.Size([2, 64001])
Signal:  torch.Size([1, 64001])

Note: In order to ensure the right tensor dimensions,
the harmonic component of the model's forward pass
should be removed, and the noise part should be modified
so that it is conditioned on centroid
